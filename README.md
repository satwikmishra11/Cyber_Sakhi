# Cyber Sakhi

Cyber Sakhi is an AI-driven tool designed to enhance online safety, particularly for individuals facing online threats, with a strong focus on protecting girls and women. The tool scans social media platforms for misuse of personal data, online harassment, and other digital threats. With increasing cases of cyberstalking, cyberbullying, and non-consensual content sharing, Cyber Sakhi acts as a digital guardian, providing users with real-time alerts and automating reports to cybercrime helplines to ensure swift action against digital threats.

## Aim

The primary goal of Cyber Sakhi is to create a safer digital environment by detecting and mitigating cyber threats proactively. It aims to:
- Protect users from cyber harassment, impersonation, and privacy breaches.
- Empower individuals, particularly girls and women, with tools to report and prevent digital crimes.
- Facilitate quick response and legal action against perpetrators through automated reporting.
- Raise awareness about digital safety and provide guidance on handling online threats.

## Methodology

Cyber Sakhi employs a combination of artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to identify, analyze, and mitigate online threats. The methodology includes:
1. **Data Collection:** The system scans publicly available social media content and, with permission, private messages for indicators of cyber threats.
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Advanced machine learning models analyze content patterns to detect abusive language, deepfake threats, impersonation, and cyberstalking behaviors.
3. **Threat Classification:** AI models categorize threats based on severity, prioritizing cases involving non-consensual content sharing, harassment, or identity theft.
4. **Alert Generation:** If a potential threat is detected, the user receives instant alerts detailing the issue and recommended actions.
5. **Automated Reporting:** Verified threats generate reports that include evidence, timestamps, and relevant details, which can be forwarded to cybercrime authorities for legal intervention.
6. **User Support:** Cyber Sakhi provides legal resources, mental health support, and digital safety guides to help users handle cyber threats effectively.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login to the Cyber Sakhi platform ensures that only authorized users can access the service.
2. **Social Media Scanning:** AI-powered algorithms continuously monitor public posts, private messages (if permissions are granted), and other digital footprints to detect unauthorized use of personal data, impersonation, and threats.
3. **Threat Analysis:** Using advanced machine learning models, Cyber Sakhi identifies patterns of harassment, cyberstalking, deepfake threats, and abusive content targeting individuals, especially girls and women.
4. **Alert Mechanism:** Users receive instant notifications whenever a potential threat is detected, allowing them to take timely action. The system prioritizes threats involving sensitive information leaks, revenge porn attempts, or targeted cyberbullying.
5. **Automated Reporting:** If a threat is confirmed, Cyber Sakhi can automatically generate detailed reports containing evidence, timestamps, and context, which users can forward directly to cybercrime authorities or legal agencies.
6. **Support and Guidance:** The platform also offers resources, including legal advice, mental health support contacts, and step-by-step guides on handling online abuse, empowering users to navigate digital spaces safely.
